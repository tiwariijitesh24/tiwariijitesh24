# 🔎 About Me
- 🔭 Aspiring Software Engineer focused on **AI / ML** and real-world applications.  
- 🧠 Strong in **Python**, now using **C** for systems-level practice and performance-focused tasks. *(Converted my low-level codebase from C++ → C to sharpen fundamentals.)*  
- 🌱 Currently building **Streamlit** apps to deploy ML projects and interactive demos.  
- 🎯 Goal: become a full-stack ML engineer — from model to production UI.

---

# 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, C, SQL  
- **AI / ML:** NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, transformers (LLMs), regression/classification models  
- **Deployment / Apps:** Streamlit, Flask (basics), Docker (learning)  
- **Data & DBs:** MySQL, MongoDB (learning)  
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Colab
